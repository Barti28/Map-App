The app is build in ReactJs (React is  a Javascript Library). Download the folder and open windows power shell or make Git bash here and to run the application:npm start.
I wanted to do this project with components and you can see it in the component file with Location.js / Map.Js / Main.Js and how it got into App.js even though it is not functional, but I left it as a comment because I can't share that state.The environment of code is  Visual Studio Code and commands for launching an app in react are provided by the terminal.

The tasks and the purpose for this project were:
Communication between tabs or windows
Task description
Our web application is to be extended by a communication between tabs or
windows. This function is intended to make it possible to use the application on
two screens.
Develop a web application that supports the following behavior in addition to
Figure 1:
1. The application is opened twice in different tabs or windows:
Tab1: http://localhost:3000/locations
Tab2: http://localhost:3000/map
2. By selecting a location in the left window, the corresponding image opens in the right
window.
3. It should work with the same-origin policy. So, stored data will only be available on the
same origin (not CORS).

Requirements
Please fulfill the following implementation requirements:
• The web application is to be implemented in ReactJS.
• Based on the description above, the possibilities for the implementation should be
evaluated. Figure 2 shows our first idea. But it doesn't have to be the most ideal
solution.
• The styling isn't important for us during this task - we are much more interested in the
implementation of the function. Please follow the example in Figure 1. We have also
provided you with two images of the locations for this purpose.
• The compatibility with Internet Explorer is not necessary. ;-)
• Document your code and create a readme file.
